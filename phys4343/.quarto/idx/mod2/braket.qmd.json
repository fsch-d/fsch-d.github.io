$\\mathscr{H}$.  \nIt represents a **quantum state**, for example a wave function or a spin state.\n\n## Bra-vectors\nA **bra vector** $\\bra{\\beta}$ denotes an element of the dual space of $\\mathscr{H}$.  \nIt is a linear form that maps each vector in $\\mathscr{H}$ into the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$ by means of the **inner product**:\n\n$$\n\\braket{\\beta}{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{C}.\n$$\n\nFor example, a wave function $\\psi(\\vec{r})$ corresponding to a state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is obtained by mapping it into coordinate space using the inner product:\n\n$$\n\\braket{\\vec{r}}{\\psi} = \\psi(\\vec{r}).\n$$\n\n### Inner product for wave functions\nFor two wave functions $\\psi(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$, the inner product is defined as\n\n$$\n\\braket{\\phi}{\\psi} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi^\\ast(x)\\,\\psi(x)\\,dx,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi^\\ast(x)$ is the complex conjugate of $\\phi(x)$.  \nThis definition guarantees that inner products are complex numbers, and it provides the mathematical foundation for probability amplitudes in quantum mechanics.\n\n## Linear operators\nAn **operator** $\\hat{O}$ acting on a ket creates another ket:\n\n$$\n\\hat{O}\\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\phi}.\n$$\n\nA **linear operator** satisfies the two additional conditions:\n\n1. $\\hat{O}(\\ket{\\psi}+\\ket{\\phi}) = \\hat{O}\\ket{\\psi} + \\hat{O}\\ket{\\phi}$  \n2. $\\hat{O}c\\ket{\\psi} = c\\hat{O}\\ket{\\psi}$\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The operator can also be written as an outer product:  \n  $$\n  \\hat{O} = \\frac{1}{\\braket{\\psi}{\\psi}} \\ketbra{\\phi}{\\psi}.\n  $$\n- If $\\{\\ket{\\phi_i}\\}$ is a complete basis of $\\mathscr{H}$, a linear operator $\\hat{O}$ can be written as a matrix with entries  \n  $$\n  O_{ij} = \\mel{\\phi_j}{\\hat{O}}{\\phi_i}.\n  $$\n\n## Hermitian conjugates\nThe **Hermitian conjugate** of a vector or operator is denoted by a $\\dagger$ (called *dagger*).  \nThe rules are:\n\n- The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.  \n- The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate (denoted with a superscript $^\\ast$).  \n- The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself.  \n- For any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators in bra–ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate is computed by reversing the order and taking the conjugate of each component.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- $\\ket{\\psi}^\\dagger = \\bra{\\psi}$ and $\\bra{\\psi}^\\dagger = \\ket{\\psi}$  \n- $\\big(c_1\\ket{\\psi_1} + c_2\\ket{\\psi_2}\\big)^\\dagger = c_1^\\ast \\bra{\\psi_1} + c_2^\\ast \\bra{\\psi_2}$  \n- $\\big(\\braket{\\psi}{\\phi}\\big)^\\dagger = \\braket{\\psi}{\\phi}^\\ast = \\braket{\\phi}{\\psi}$  \n- $\\big(\\mel{\\phi}{\\hat{A}^\\dagger}{\\psi}\\big)^\\ast = \\mel{\\psi}{\\hat{A}}{\\phi}$  \n  and  \n  $\\big(\\mel{\\phi}{\\hat{A}^\\dagger \\hat{B}^\\dagger}{\\psi}\\big)^\\ast = \\mel{\\psi}{\\hat{B}\\hat{A}}{\\phi}$  \n\n## Observables\n**Observables** are represented by Hermitian operators. “Hermitian” means $\\hat{A} = \\hat{A}^\\dagger$.  \nThey are associated with measurable physical quantities (e.g., energy, momentum, angular momentum, spin).\n\n### Properties\n- The eigenvalues $a$ of a Hermitian operator $\\hat{A}$, satisfying $\\hat{A}\\ket{\\alpha} = a\\ket{\\alpha}$, are **real numbers**.  \n- For every observable, a **complete and orthonormal basis** can be found:  \n  - The basis is given by eigenvectors solving  \n    $\\hat{A}\\ket{n} = a_n\\ket{n}$ (discrete spectrum) or $\\hat{A}\\ket{k} = k\\ket{k}$ (continuous spectrum).  \n  - Orthonormality: $\\braket{n'}{n} = \\delta_{n'n}$ or $\\braket{k_i}{k_j} = \\delta(k_i-k_j)$.  \n  - Completeness: every state $\\ket{\\psi}$ in $\\mathscr{H}$ can be expressed as  \n    $\\ket{\\psi} = \\sum_n c_n\\ket{n}$ or $\\ket{\\psi} = \\int c(k)\\ket{k}\\,dk$.  \n  - The identity operator can be written as $\\mathbb{1} = \\sum_n \\ketbra{n}{n}$ or $\\mathbb{1} = \\int \\ketbra{k}{k}\\,dk$.\n\n### Additional notes\nIf $\\ket{\\alpha}$ is a normalized eigenvector of $\\hat{A}$ and the system is in the normalized state $\\ket{\\psi}$, then:\n\n- The probability of finding the system in state $\\ket{\\alpha}$ is  \n  $$\n  P = \\left|\\braket{\\alpha}{\\psi}\\right|^2.\n  $$\n- The expectation value of $\\hat{A}$ is  \n  $$\n  \\langle \\hat{A} \\rangle = \\mel{\\psi}{\\hat{A}}{\\psi}.\n  $$\n- The variance of $\\hat{A}$ is  \n  $$\n  \\sigma_A = \\langle \\hat{A}^2 \\rangle - \\langle \\hat{A} \\rangle^2.\n  $$\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n##
