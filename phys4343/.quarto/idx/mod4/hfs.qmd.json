Hyperfine Hamiltonian and multipole expansion\n\nThe interaction between the electronic degrees of freedom and nuclear moments can be written in a multipole (tensor) expansion. A compact operator form is\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\;=\\; \\sum_k \\hat{T}^{(k)} \\cdot \\hat{N}^{(k)},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{T}^{(k)}$ is a rank-$k$ spherical tensor acting on electronic coordinates and $\\hat{N}^{(k)}$ is a rank-$k$ spherical tensor acting on nuclear coordinates. The most important terms are:\n\n- $k=1$: magnetic dipole interaction (dominant in many atoms),  \n- $k=2$: electric quadrupole interaction (important when the nuclear spin is $I\\ge 1$),  \n- higher $k$: smaller multipoles (usually negligible for atomic spectroscopy).\n\nIn this section we concentrate on the magnetic-dipole ($k=1$) term.\n\n# 2.

It is often the most practical starting point for calculating level splittings.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Relation to the electronic internal field\n\nPhysically, $A$ measures the strength of the magnetic field produced by the electrons at the nucleus, weighted by the nuclear magnetic moment. For $s$-electrons, the dominant contribution is the **Fermi contact interaction**, which scales with the electronic probability density at the nucleus:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text{contact}} \\;\\propto\\; g_N \\,\\mu_N \\, |\\psi(0)|^2,\n$$\n\nwhere $g_N$ is the nuclear $g$-factor, $\\mu_N$ the nuclear magneton, and $|\\psi(0)|^2$ the electron density at the origin.\n\nFor general electronic states, $A$ can be related to the internal magnetic field $\\vec{B}_J$ generated by the electrons. As a scaling estimate one often writes\n\n$$\nA \\;\\sim\\; \\frac{g_N \\,\\mu_N \\, B_J}{\\sqrt{J(J+1)}},\n$$\n\nwhich exhibits the dependence of $A$ on the nuclear moment and the effective electronic field. The precise value of $B_J$ (and therefore $A$) requires evaluation of the appropriate electronic expectation values and/or detailed atomic-structure calculations.\n:::\n\n## 2.1 Worked numerical/physical example (sketch)\n\nTo compute $A$ from first principles (outline):\n\n1. Compute the electronic wavefunction $\\psi(\\mathbf r)$ (including relativistic effects if required).  \n2. Evaluate the electronic magnetic field at the nucleus (Fermi contact term for $s$-states): integrals of the form $\\propto |\\psi(0)|^2$ or more complicated integrals for non-$s$ states.  \n3. Multiply by the nuclear moment $g_N\\mu_N$ and convert to energy units.  \n\nIn practice, atomic-structure codes or experimental measurements provide accurate values for $A$.\n\n\n---\n\n# 3. Angular-momentum algebra and the energy formula\n\nThe treatment of hyperfine structure closely parallels the **LS coupling scheme** already discussed: just as $\\hat{\\vec J} = \\hat{\\vec L} + \\hat{\\vec S}$ combines orbital and spin angular momentum, here we combine the **electronic total angular momentum** $\\hat{\\vec J}$ with the **nuclear spin** $\\hat{\\vec I}$ to form the **total atomic angular momentum** $\\hat{\\vec F}$:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{F}} = \\hat{\\vec{J}} + \\hat{\\vec{I}}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n## 3.1 Operator identities\n\nThe squared total angular momentum operator satisfies\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{F}}^{\\,2} = \\hat{\\vec{J}}^{\\,2} + \\hat{\\vec{I}}^{\\,2} + 2\\,\\hat{\\vec{J}}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{I}}.\n$$\n\nFrom this we obtain\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{J}}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{I}} \\;=\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\Big(\\hat{\\vec{F}}^{\\,2} - \\hat{\\vec{I}}^{\\,2} - \\hat{\\vec{J}}^{\\,2}\\Big).\n$$\n\nHence the hyperfine Hamiltonian becomes\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\mathrm{HF}} \\;=\\; A\\,\\hat{\\vec{I}}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{J}}\n\\;=\\; \\tfrac{A}{2}\\Big(\\hat{\\vec{F}}^{\\,2} - \\hat{\\vec{I}}^{\\,2} - \\hat{\\vec{J}}^{\\,2}\\Big).\n$$\n\n---\n\n## 3.2 New atomic eigenstates\n\nBecause $\\hat{\\vec F}$ is the relevant conserved total angular momentum, the natural basis states are\n\n$$\n|\\;L, S, J, I;\\; F, M_F\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $F$ is the quantum number of $\\hat{\\vec F}^2$,  \n- $M_F$ is the quantum number of $\\hat F_z$,  \n- $M_J$ and $M_I$ are no longer individually good quantum numbers once the hyperfine interaction is included.\n\n> **Remark.**  \n> - **Lowercase letters** ($\\ell, s, j$) denote quantum numbers for a single electron.  \n>   - $\\ell$ (orbital angular momentum of a single electron).  \n>   - $s$ (spin angular momentum of a single electron).  \n>   - $j$ (total angular momentum of a single electron).  \n> - **Capital letters** ($L, S, J, F$) denote **total angular momentum quantum numbers** arising from the coupling of multiple components:  \n>   - $L$ (total orbital angular momentum of the electrons).  \n>   - $S$ (total electron spin).  \n>   - $J = L+S$ (total electronic angular momentum).  \n>   - $F = J+I$ (total atomic angular momentum, including nuclear spin $I$).  \n\nThus, the hyperfine eigenstates are labeled by the coupled quantum numbers $(L, S, J, I, F, M_F)$, with $F$ and $M_F$ replacing $M_J$ and $M_I$ as the good quantum numbers once hyperfine interactions are included.\n\n---\n\n## 3.3 Eigenvalue relations and energy formula\n\nFor angular momentum operators, the general eigenvalue relation is\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec F}^{\\,2} \\,|F, M_F\\rangle \\;=\\; F(F+1)\\hbar^2 \\, |F, M_F\\rangle.\n$$\n\nAnalogous relations hold for $\\hat{\\vec J}^{\\,2}$ and $\\hat{\\vec I}^{\\,2}$.\n\nSubstituting the eigenvalues of $\\hat{\\vec F}^2, \\hat{\\vec I}^2, \\hat{\\vec J}^2$ into the Hamiltonian, the hyperfine energy shift for a given $F$ is\n\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(F) \\;=\\; \\frac{A}{2}\\Big[ F(F+1) - I(I+1) - J(J+1)\\Big].\n$$\n\n---\n\n## 3.4 Possible $F$ values\n\nThe possible values of $F$ follow the vector addition rule of angular momenta:\n\n$$\nF = |I - J|,\\, |I - J|+1, \\dots, I + J.\n$$\n\nThus there are $(2\\,\\min(I,J)+1)$ hyperfine components for a given electronic level labeled by $J$ and a fixed nucleus with spin $I$.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Hyperfine structure is obtained by coupling $\\vec J$ and $\\vec I$ in direct analogy with LS coupling.  \n- The good quantum numbers are now $F$ and $M_F$.  \n- The well-known formula\n\n  $$\n  \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{HF}}(F) = \\tfrac{A}{2}\\Big[F(F+1) - I(I+1) - J(J+1)\\Big]\n  $$\n\n  describes the zero-field splitting between hyperfine levels.\n\n---\n\n# 4.

For hydrogen the $F=1$ level lies above the $F=0$ level (positive $A$), producing the emitted 21-cm photon for the $F=1\\to F=0$ transition in spontaneous emission.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Finite-nucleus and higher-order corrections\n\nA few further points important for precision work:\n\n- **Finite nuclear size.** The nucleus is not pointlike. For $s$-electrons the finite nuclear charge distribution modifies $|\\psi(0)|^2$ and therefore shifts $A$. This is not a QED effect but is routinely included in precision hyperfine calculations.  \n- **Electric quadrupole ($k=2$).** If the nucleus has $I\\ge 1$, there is an additional quadrupole interaction, which splits $F$ states further (tensor coupling).  \n- **Higher-order QED corrections.** Radiative corrections (self-energy, vacuum polarization, recoil, etc.) slightly modify $A$ and the hyperfine energies; these are included when very high accuracy is required.\n\n---\n\n# 6. The Significance of Hyperfine Structure\n\nThe tiny energy shifts caused by the hyperfine interaction—the coupling between the electron's total angular momentum and the nucleus's spin—have profound and far-reaching consequences in modern physics and technology. While seemingly small, this interaction provides an exquisitely precise and stable quantum reference, which we can harness for a wide variety of applications.\n\nHere are a few key examples:\n\n* **Foundation of Atomic Clocks:** Perhaps the most famous application is the **atomic clock**. The current definition of the SI second is based on the transition frequency between two hyperfine energy levels in a cesium-133 atom. This transition is so stable and precise that it allows for timekeeping with an accuracy of one second in millions of years. This incredible precision is essential for GPS, telecommunications, and a host of other technologies that rely on exact timing.\n\n* **Quantum Computing and Qubits:** The well-defined, stable energy levels of hyperfine states make them ideal candidates for building **qubits**, the fundamental units of quantum information. Systems like trapped ions and neutral atoms are used to encode quantum information in their hyperfine states, providing a robust platform for quantum computing and quantum simulation. Their long coherence times allow them to store information for an extended period, which is a crucial requirement for building a quantum computer. \n\n* **Medical Imaging:** **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** relies on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is a form of hyperfine spectroscopy. In an MRI machine, a strong magnetic field is used to split the nuclear spin energy levels of hydrogen atoms in the body's water molecules. By applying radiofrequency pulses, these nuclei can be excited and their subsequent relaxation provides detailed information about the tissues and organs, creating the high-resolution images used in medical diagnostics.\n\n* **Chemical Analysis and NMR Spectroscopy:** On a smaller scale, **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy** is an indispensable tool in chemistry. It exploits the same principles as MRI to determine the structure of molecules. By analyzing the unique hyperfine splitting patterns of atomic nuclei, chemists can identify the types of atoms in a molecule and their spatial arrangement, providing a powerful method for structural elucidation.\n\n* **Astrophysical Observations:** Hyperfine transitions are also critical in astronomy. The famous **21-cm hydrogen line** is a hyperfine transition in neutral atomic hydrogen. The radiation emitted or absorbed at this specific wavelength allows astronomers to map the distribution of vast clouds of interstellar hydrogen gas throughout our galaxy and beyond. This has provided invaluable insights into the structure and dynamics of the universe.\n\n* **Fundamental Physics Research:** The remarkable precision of hyperfine transitions makes them perfect for testing the fundamental laws of physics. By using atomic clocks, physicists can perform high-precision tests of **General Relativity** by measuring gravitational redshift. They are also used to search for new physics, such as a time variation of the fundamental constants of nature or violations of fundamental symmetries.\n\n* **Metrology and Standards:** Beyond the SI second, hyperfine transitions are used as highly stable frequency references for a variety of precision measurements. They form the basis of **magnetometers** and other sensitive measurement tools used in metrology and fundamental research.\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n# Hyperfine Structure: Overview and Plan\n\nThis section introduces the interaction between the atomic electrons and nuclear moments that gives rise to **hyperfine structure (HFS)** in atomic spectra.

Example: Hydrogen ground state ($1s_{1/2}$)\n\nFor the hydrogen atom in the ground state:\n\n- Nuclear spin $I=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ (proton),  \n- Electronic total angular momentum $J=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ (from the $1s_{1/2}$ electron).\n\nPossible values of $F$ are\n\n$$\nF = I+J = 1 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad F = |I-J| = 0.\n$$\n\nThe hyperfine energies (relative to some reference) are\n\n$$\n\\Delta E_{F} \\;=\\; \\frac{A}{2}\\big[ F(F+1) - I(I+1) - J(J+1)\\big].\n$$\n\nEvaluating for $F=1$ and $F=0$ gives a doublet; the measured splitting (for hydrogen) corresponds to the well-known 21-cm line in astronomy.\n\n```{python}\n#| echo: false\n#| output: false\n# fig-format: svg\n# fig-align: center\n# fig-cap: Hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen ground state.\n# fig-alt: Hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen ground state.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n#import matplotlib as mpl\n#mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [3, 2]\n\ndef plot_hyperfine_splitting():\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4.5, 3))\n\n    # --- Initial State (1S_1/2) ---\n    ax.hlines(0, -2, 0, color='black', lw=2)\n    ax.text(-1.9, 0.05, r'$1 ^2S_{1/2}$', va='bottom', ha='left', fontsize=14)\n\n    # --- Dashed Line to indicate splitting ---\n    ax.plot([0, 2], [0, 0], linestyle='--', color='black', lw=1)\n    ax.plot([0, .5], [0, -0.75], linestyle='--', color='black', lw=1)\n    ax.plot([0, .5], [0, 0.25], linestyle='--', color='black', lw=1)\n\n    # --- Hyperfine Split States ---\n    # F=0 (lower level)\n    f0_energy = -0.75\n    ax.hlines(f0_energy, 0.5, 2, color='black', lw=2)\n    ax.text(2.1, f0_energy, r'$F=0$', va='center', ha='left', fontsize=14)\n\n    # F=1 (upper level)\n    f1_energy = 0.25\n    ax.hlines(f1_energy, 0.5, 2, color='black', lw=2)\n    ax.text(2.1, f1_energy, r'$F=1$', va='center', ha='left', fontsize=14)\n\n    # --- Energy Differences (Arrows and Labels) ---\n    # Arrow for 3A/4\n    ax.annotate(\"\", xy=(1.2, f0_energy), xytext=(1.2, 0),\n                arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"<->\", lw=1.5, color='black'))\n    ax.text(1.25, f0_energy / 2, r'$3A/4$', ha='left', va='center', fontsize=12)\n\n    # Arrow for A/4\n    ax.annotate(\"\", xy=(1.2, 0), xytext=(1.2, f1_energy),\n                arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"<->\", lw=1.5, color='black'))\n    ax.text(1.25, (0 + f1_energy) / 2, r'$A/4$', ha='left', va='center', fontsize=12)\n\n\n    # --- Plot Aesthetics ---\n    ax.set_ylim(-1.0, 0.5) # Adjust y-limits to fit diagram\n    ax.set_xlim(-2.5, 2.7) # Adjust x-limits\n    ax.axis('off') # Hide axes\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.savefig('hyperfine.svg', format='svg')\n    #plt.show()\n\nplot_hyperfine_splitting()\n```\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n![Hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen ground state](./hyperfine.svg){fig-alt=\"Hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen ground state.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## 4.1 Comments on the sign and ordering\n\nThe sign of $A$ determines which $F$ level lies higher. For hydrogen the $F=1$ level lies above the $F=0$ level (positive $A$), producing the emitted 21-cm photon for the $F=1\\to F=0$ transition in spontaneous emission.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Finite-nucleus and higher-order corrections\n\nA few further points important for precision work:\n\n- **Finite nuclear size.** The nucleus is not pointlike. For $s$-electrons the finite nuclear charge distribution modifies $|\\psi(0)|^2$ and therefore shifts $A$. This is not a QED effect but is routinely included in precision hyperfine calculations.  \n- **Electric quadrupole ($k=2$).** If the nucleus has $I\\ge 1$, there is an additional quadrupole interaction, which splits $F$ states further (tensor coupling).  \n- **Higher-order QED corrections.** Radiative corrections (self-energy, vacuum polarization, recoil, etc.) slightly modify $A$ and the hyperfine energies; these are included when very high accuracy is required.\n\n---\n\n# 6. The Significance of Hyperfine Structure\n\nThe tiny energy shifts caused by the hyperfine interaction—the coupling between the electron's total angular momentum and the nucleus's spin—have profound and far-reaching consequences in modern physics and technology. While seemingly small, this interaction provides an exquisitely precise and stable quantum reference, which we can harness for a wide variety of applications.\n\nHere are a few key examples:\n\n* **Foundation of Atomic Clocks:** Perhaps the most famous application is the **atomic clock**. The current definition of the SI second is based on the transition frequency between two hyperfine energy levels in a cesium-133 atom. This transition is so stable and precise that it allows for timekeeping with an accuracy of one second in millions of years. This incredible precision is essential for GPS, telecommunications, and a host of other technologies that rely on exact timing.\n\n* **Quantum Computing and Qubits:** The well-defined, stable energy levels of hyperfine states make them ideal candidates for building **qubits**, the fundamental units of quantum information. Systems like trapped ions and neutral atoms are used to encode quantum information in their hyperfine states, providing a robust platform for quantum computing and quantum simulation. Their long coherence times allow them to store information for an extended period, which is a crucial requirement for building a quantum computer. \n\n* **Medical Imaging:** **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** relies on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is a form of hyperfine spectroscopy. In an MRI machine, a strong magnetic field is used to split the nuclear spin energy levels of hydrogen atoms in the body's water molecules. By applying radiofrequency pulses, these nuclei can be excited and their subsequent relaxation provides detailed information about the tissues and organs, creating the high-resolution images used in medical diagnostics.\n\n* **Chemical Analysis and NMR Spectroscopy:** On a smaller scale, **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy** is an indispensable tool in chemistry. It exploits the same principles as MRI to determine the structure of molecules. By analyzing the unique hyperfine splitting patterns of atomic nuclei, chemists can identify the types of atoms in a molecule and their spatial arrangement, providing a powerful method for structural elucidation.\n\n* **Astrophysical Observations:** Hyperfine transitions are also critical in astronomy. The famous **21-cm hydrogen line** is a hyperfine transition in neutral atomic hydrogen. The radiation emitted or absorbed at this specific wavelength allows astronomers to map the distribution of vast clouds of interstellar hydrogen gas throughout our galaxy and beyond. This has provided invaluable insights into the structure and dynamics of the universe.\n\n* **Fundamental Physics Research:** The remarkable precision of hyperfine transitions makes them perfect for testing the fundamental laws of physics. By using atomic clocks, physicists can perform high-precision tests of **General Relativity** by measuring gravitational redshift. They are also used to search for new physics, such as a time variation of the fundamental constants of nature or violations of fundamental symmetries.\n\n* **Metrology and Standards:** Beyond the SI second, hyperfine transitions are used as highly stable frequency references for a variety of precision measurements. They form the basis of **magnetometers** and other sensitive measurement tools used in metrology and fundamental research.\n\n---\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"embed-resources":true,"self-contained":true,"html-math-method":"mathjax","output-file":"hfs.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
