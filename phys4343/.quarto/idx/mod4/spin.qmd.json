Historical Pretext\n\nBefore introducing the modern concept of electron spin, it is useful to recall two classic experiments that shaped our understanding of angular momentum and magnetic moments in atoms: the **Stern–Gerlach experiment** (1922) and the **Einstein–de Haas experiment** (1915).\n\nThese experiments predate the explicit formulation of electron spin, and neither was originally interpreted in terms of spin. Nevertheless, they demonstrated crucial features of angular momentum quantization and the connection between angular momentum and magnetism.\n\n## 1.1 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment\n\nIn 1922, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach sent a beam of neutral silver atoms through an **inhomogeneous magnetic field** ([Stern & Gerlach, 1922](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01326983){target=\"_blank\"}).  \n\n- **Setup**: A heated oven produces a **jet of silver atoms**, which is then collimated into a narrow beam. The beam enters a region between specially shaped **magnet poles**, arranged so that the magnetic field is not uniform but has a strong vertical gradient.  \n- After passing through the magnet, the atoms travel to a distant **detection screen**, where their spatial distribution can be recorded.\n\n**What happens physically?**  \nThe silver atom has a single unpaired electron, whose magnetic moment interacts with the field gradient. Classically, one would expect a continuous spread of deflections depending on the orientation of the magnetic moment. Instead, the beam splits cleanly into two spots on the screen. This demonstrates that the angular momentum component along the field axis can take only discrete\nvalues — the phenomenon of **spatial quantization** (Richtungsquantelung).\n\n![Stern–Gerlach experiment: an atomic beam is split into two distinct components by the inhomogeneous magnetic field, showing discrete orientations of angular momentum.

Because each magnetic moment is associated with angular momentum, conservation of angular momentum requires the cylinder itself to rotate in the opposite direction. The effect is small but measurable, and the mirror–light setup amplifies the detection. The experiment showed that **magnetization arises from angular momentum**. However, the ratio of magnetic moment to angular momentum was found to differ by a factor of two from classical expectations — a puzzle later resolved by the discovery of electron spin.\n\n![Einstein–de Haas experiment: reversing the magnetization of a suspended ferromagnetic cylinder induces mechanical rotation, detected via a mirror and probe light. Important components: suspended cylinder, surrounding coil, ferromagnetic core, and optical detection system.](edehaas.png){width=50% fig-alt=\"Einstein–de Haas experiment: reversing the magnetization of a suspended ferromagnetic cylinder induces mechanical rotation, detected via a mirror and probe light.\"}\n\n---\n\n## 1.3 Historical Perspective\n\nAt the time of their original publication, neither the Stern–Gerlach nor the Einstein–de Haas experiment was interpreted in terms of an intrinsic electron spin — the very concept did not yet exist. Instead, both were framed within the language of **orbital angular momentum** and the then-prevailing Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom.\n\n### The Stern–Gerlach experiment\n\nStern and Gerlach themselves interpreted their observation of beam splitting as evidence for the **quantization of orbital angular momentum** along the field axis (“Richtungsquantelung”). Within the Bohr–Sommerfeld picture, an electron orbiting in a quantized elliptical trajectory would carry an orbital magnetic moment. Measuring its projection along the $z$-axis should then yield discrete values, consistent with their result.  \n\nWhat is striking in hindsight is that the silver atom has only a single valence electron in an $s$-orbital ($\\ell = 0$). The Schrödinger wave mechanics (formulated a few years later, in 1926) would predict **no orbital magnetic moment at all** in this case, and thus no splitting. Yet Stern and Gerlach observed **two distinct components**, not more and not less.  \n\nThis outcome was “accidentally” consistent with the Bohr–Sommerfeld model, which predicted two possible orientations for the angular momentum in this situation, but it could not be reconciled with a purely orbital picture once quantum mechanics matured. Only the later concept of an intrinsic two-valuedness of the electron (Pauli, 1925) and the introduction of spin provided the correct interpretation: the silver beam splits into two components because the unpaired electron has spin $s = \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\n### The Einstein–de Haas experiment\n\nEinstein and de Haas (1915) were motivated by the idea of **ring currents** — circulating electrons in atomic orbits — as the microscopic origin of magnetization. Their experiment showed directly that reversing the magnetization of a ferromagnetic sample induces mechanical rotation of the whole body, thus establishing the deep connection between **magnetic moments and angular momentum**.  \n\nHowever, when they compared the proportionality, they encountered a puzzle: the magnetic moment per unit angular momentum came out to be about **twice** the classical value expected from orbital currents. This discrepancy was a mystery at the time. In their language, it was often expressed as a “gyromagnetic ratio” differing by a factor of two from theoretical expectations.  \n\nIt was only later, with the recognition that the electron carries an intrinsic spin with $g \\approx 2$, that this factor found its natural explanation. In other words, the Einstein–de Haas effect had already measured the electron’s $g$-factor without knowing that spin existed.\n\n### Synthesis\n\nFrom today’s perspective, both experiments provided indirect evidence for electron spin long before the concept was articulated. But historically, they were interpreted through the lens of orbital angular momentum:  \n\n- **Stern–Gerlach**: seen as proof of spatial quantization of orbital angular momentum projections, though the peculiar “two-spot” pattern foreshadowed something deeper.  \n- **Einstein–de Haas**: seen as proof that magnetism stems from angular momentum, though the anomalous factor of two hinted at a hidden degree of freedom.  \n\nOnly with Pauli’s exclusion principle (1925) and the proposal of electron spin by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (1925) were these puzzles fully understood. The reinterpretation of these classic experiments thus marks a turning point in atomic physics — from the orbital models of Bohr–Sommerfeld to the modern framework of quantum mechanics with spin.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# 2. The Electron Spin\n\nElectrons possess an **intrinsic angular momentum** called **spin** ($\\hat{\\vec{S}}$). Unlike orbital angular momentum, spin has **no classical analog**: it is a purely quantum property that must be described algebraically.  \n\nThe spin operator satisfies the **same eigenvalue equations** as orbital angular momentum:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{S}}^2 |s,m_s\\rangle = \\hbar^2 s(s+1)\\,|s,m_s\\rangle, \n\\qquad\n\\hat{S}_z |s,m_s\\rangle = \\hbar m_s\\,|s,m_s\\rangle.\n$$\n\nIn addition, the spin components obey the **same commutation relations** as the orbital angular momentum operators:\n\n$$\n[\\hat{S}_i, \\hat{S}_j] = i\\hbar\\,\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\,\\hat{S}_k,\n$$\n\nwith $\\varepsilon_{ijk}$ the Levi-Civita symbol.  \n\nFor a single electron, the spin quantum number $s$ and the magnetic spin quantum number $m_s$ take the values:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\ns &= \\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\\nm_s &= \\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n## 2.1 Notation\n\nIt is conventional to introduce the shorthand:\n\n* **Spin-up**: $|\\tfrac{1}{2}, +\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle \\equiv |\\uparrow\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$\n* **Spin-down**: $|\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle \\equiv |\\downarrow\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nUnlike orbital states, there is **no spatial wavefunction representation** for spin alone. Electron spin is a purely quantum property and does not correspond, as orbital angular momentum does, to the rotation of an object in space. Therefore, there is no coordinate-space representation of the spin operator (such as a differential operator) and no spatial wavefunction for spin. Instead, spin states are always described algebraically by two-component spinors.  \n\n## 2.2 Spin Operators\n\nTo satisfy the eigenvalue and commutation relations, the spin operators are represented using the **Pauli matrices**, which provide a concrete $2\\times 2$ matrix representation of spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ systems. Unlike orbital angular momentum, which is represented by differential operators acting on spatial wavefunctions, spin has no spatial representation and is instead described purely through this matrix formalism.\n\n$$\n\\hat{S}_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,\\sigma_x, \n\\qquad\n\\hat{S}_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,\\sigma_y, \n\\qquad\n\\hat{S}_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,\\sigma_z,\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Proof\n\n#### 1. Commutator relations\n\nWe want to show that\n$$\n[\\hat{S}_i, \\hat{S}_j] = i \\hbar \\, \\varepsilon_{ijk} \\hat{S}_k\n$$\nfor $i,j,k = x,y,z$.\n\n**Step 1:** Write $\\hat{S}_i = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_i$, then\n$$\n[\\hat{S}_i, \\hat{S}_j] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j].\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Recall the Pauli matrix commutators:\n$$\n[\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y] = 2i \\sigma_z, \\quad\n[\\sigma_y, \\sigma_z] = 2i \\sigma_x, \\quad\n[\\sigma_z, \\sigma_x] = 2i \\sigma_y.\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Compute the commutators of the Pauli matrices.\n\n- Example: compute $[\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y] = \\sigma_x \\sigma_y - \\sigma_y \\sigma_x$:\n$$\n\\sigma_x \\sigma_y = \n\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\ 0 & -i \\end{pmatrix} = i \\sigma_z,\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sigma_y \\sigma_x = \n\\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}-i & 0 \\\\ 0 & i \\end{pmatrix} = -i \\sigma_z.\n$$\n\n- Therefore,\n$$\n[\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y] = \\sigma_x \\sigma_y - \\sigma_y \\sigma_x = i\\sigma_z - (-i\\sigma_z) = 2i \\sigma_z.\n$$\n\n- Similarly,\n$$\n[\\sigma_y, \\sigma_z] = 2i \\sigma_x, \\quad\n[\\sigma_z, \\sigma_x] = 2i \\sigma_y.\n$$\n\nThis shows explicitly how the commutators arise directly from the matrix multiplication.\n\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply by $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{4}$:\n$$\n[\\hat{S}_x, \\hat{S}_y] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} \\cdot 2i \\sigma_z = i\\hbar \\hat{S}_z,\n$$\nand similarly for the other pairs.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Squared spin operator $\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^2$\n\n$\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^2 = \\hat{S}_x^2 + \\hat{S}_y^2 + \\hat{S}_z^2$.\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the Pauli matrices:\n$$\n\\hat{S}_x^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_x^2, \\quad\n\\hat{S}_y^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_y^2, \\quad\n\\hat{S}_z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_z^2.\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Use $\\sigma_i^2 = I_2$ for all Pauli matrices:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} (I_2 + I_2 + I_2) = \\frac{3}{4} \\hbar^2 I_2.\n$$\n\n**Step 3:** Action on spinors:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^2 |\\uparrow\\rangle = \\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2 |\\uparrow\\rangle, \\quad\n\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^2 |\\downarrow\\rangle = \\frac{3}{4}\\hbar^2 |\\downarrow\\rangle\n$$\n\n\n$\\Rightarrow \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}^2 |s,m_s\\rangle = \\hbar^2 s(s+1)\\,|s,m_s\\rangle.$\n\n\n---\n\n#### 3. z-component $\\hat{S}_z$\n\n$\\hat{S}_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 1:** Apply to spin-up:\n$$\n\\hat{S}_z |\\uparrow\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\uparrow\\rangle\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Apply to spin-down:\n$$\n\\hat{S}_z |\\downarrow\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\downarrow\\rangle\n$$  \n\n\n$\\Rightarrow \\hat{S}_z |s,m_s\\rangle = \\hbar m\\,|s,m_s\\rangle.$  \n\n\nThese steps explicitly show the commutation relations and eigenvalues for spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ operators.\n:::\n\n## 2.3 Spin in Hydrogen States\n\nWhen spin is included, the state of the electron in the hydrogen atom must be specified not only by the spatial quantum numbers $(n, \\ell, m_\\ell)$ but also by the spin quantum numbers $(s, m_s)$.  \n\nA **complete basis state** can thus be written as\n\n$$\n|n, \\ell, m_\\ell, s, m_s\\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhere:  \n- $n$ is the principal quantum number,  \n- $\\ell$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number,  \n- $m_\\ell$ is the magnetic quantum number of orbital angular momentum,  \n- $s = \\tfrac{1}{2}$ for an electron,  \n- $m_s = \\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}$ is the spin projection.  \n\nThis notation emphasizes that the electron’s state is a **tensor product** of its orbital part $|n,\\ell,m_\\ell\\rangle$ and its spin part $|s,m_s\\rangle$.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Magnetic Moments\n\nThe angular momentum of an electron is associated with a magnetic moment $\\vec \\mu$. There are two contributions:\n\n- **Orbital magnetic moment**: \n  $$\n  \\vec{\\mu}_\\ell = g_\\ell \\, \\mu_B \\, \\vec{L}, \\quad \\text{with } g_\\ell = 1\n  $$\n- **Spin magnetic moment**: \n  $$\n  \\vec{\\mu}_s = g_s \\, \\mu_B \\, \\vec{S}, \\quad \\text{with } g_s \\approx 2\n  $$\n\nHere, $g$ is the **g-factor**, and $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the **Bohr magneton**.  \n\nFor orbital angular momentum, $g_\\ell = 1$, which reproduces the classical relation between angular momentum and magnetic moment derived from **Larmor theory**. That is, a circulating charge creates a magnetic dipole proportional to its angular momentum, in full agreement with classical electrodynamics.  \n\nFor the electron spin, $g_s \\approx 2$, which **cannot be explained classically**. This value emerges rigorously from **relativistic quantum mechanics** via the Dirac equation (not derived here), and it is confirmed experimentally, for example in the **Einstein–de Haas experiment** (1915). The factor $g_s \\neq 1$ is therefore a pure quantum-relativistic effect, reflecting the intrinsic nature of spin.  \n\n\n---\n\n# 4. The Fine Structure Interaction\n\n## 4.1 Spin–Orbit Interaction and the Hamiltonian\n\nBecause both orbital and spin angular momenta give rise to magnetic moments, they interact with each other. This interaction contributes an additional **spin–orbit term**, $\\hat{H}_{\\rm SO}$, to the Hamiltonian. Including spin, a convenient operator form of the one-electron Hamiltonian in a central potential $V(\\hat{\\vec r})$ is\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hat{\\vec p}^{\\,2}}{2\\mu} \\;+\\; V(\\hat{\\vec r})\n\\;+\\; \\hat{H}_{\\rm SO},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf p}$ is the momentum operator, $\\mu$ the (reduced) mass, and\n$\\hat{H}_{\\rm SO}$ denotes the spin–orbit interaction, which arises due to the interaction of the magnetic moments and is\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\rm SO} \\propto \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_\\ell \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_s \\propto \\hat{\\vec{L}} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{S}} = \\hat{L}_x\\hat{S}_x + \\hat{L}_y\\hat{S}_y + \\hat{L}_z\\hat{S}_z.\n$$\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\nFor a central potential $V(r)$ the standard spin–orbit term (obtained from the\nDirac equation or from semi-classical Thomas-corrected arguments) can be written as\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{\\rm SO} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2m^2 c^2}\\,\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dV}{dr}\\;\\hat{\\vec L}\\!\\cdot\\!\\hat{\\vec S},\n$$\n\nwhere $r=|\\hat{\\vec r}|$, $\\hat{\\vec L}$ is the orbital angular momentum\noperator and $\\hat{\\mathbf S}$ the spin operator.

A fully consistent calculation of the fine structure requires additional relativistic corrections, which we do not discuss here in detail:\n\n- the **Darwin term**, arising from the \"zitterbewegung\" of the electron,  \n- and the **Thomas precession correction**, which modifies the effective strength of the spin–orbit interaction.\n\nWhen these effects are combined with the spin–orbit coupling, the result is the same fine structure spectrum that is obtained directly from the **Dirac equation**. \n\nIn the Dirac theory, the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (including the rest energy of the electron) are given by\n\n$$\nE_{n,j} \\;=\\; m c^2 \\left[ 1 + \n\\left( \\frac{Z \\alpha}{n - (j + \\tfrac{1}{2}) + \\sqrt{(j+\\tfrac{1}{2})^2 - (Z\\alpha)^2}} \\right)^2\n\\right]^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}} ,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ ($\\alpha=\\tfrac{1}{137}$) is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the nuclear charge.  \n\nThe above energies depend only on $n$ and $j$. Thus, while the Schrödinger equation with spin–orbit interaction suggests a dependence on $\\ell$, the **full relativistic treatment (or including the missing correction terms) removes this $\\ell$-dependence**.\n\n---\n\n## 4.4 Fine-Structure Energy Shift\n\nIt is often more useful to consider the **fine-structure shift** rather than the full electron energy given above. This shift can be viewed as a small correction to the non-relativistic Bohr energies, which are expressed as:\n\n$$\nE_n^{(0)} = - \\frac{\\mu c^2 (Z\\alpha)^2}{2 n^2},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the electron.

Historical Pretext\n\nBefore introducing the modern concept of electron spin, it is useful to recall two classic experiments that shaped our understanding of angular momentum and magnetic moments in atoms: the **Stern–Gerlach experiment** (1922) and the **Einstein–de Haas experiment** (1915).\n\nThese experiments predate the explicit formulation of electron spin, and neither was originally interpreted in terms of spin. Nevertheless, they demonstrated crucial features of angular momentum quantization and the connection between angular momentum and magnetism.\n\n## 1.1 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment\n\nIn 1922, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach sent a beam of neutral silver atoms through an **inhomogeneous magnetic field** ([Stern & Gerlach, 1922](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01326983){target=\"_blank\"}).  \n\n- **Setup**: A heated oven produces a **jet of silver atoms**, which is then collimated into a narrow beam. The beam enters a region between specially shaped **magnet poles**, arranged so that the magnetic field is not uniform but has a strong vertical gradient.  \n- After passing through the magnet, the atoms travel to a distant **detection screen**, where their spatial distribution can be recorded.\n\n**What happens physically?**  \nThe silver atom has a single unpaired electron, whose magnetic moment interacts with the field gradient. Classically, one would expect a continuous spread of deflections depending on the orientation of the magnetic moment. Instead, the beam splits cleanly into two spots on the screen. This demonstrates that the angular momentum component along the field axis can take only discrete\nvalues — the phenomenon of **spatial quantization** (Richtungsquantelung).\n\n![Stern–Gerlach experiment: an atomic beam is split into two distinct components by the inhomogeneous magnetic field, showing discrete orientations of angular momentum. Important components: atomic beam source (left), magnet with N/S poles (center), and detection screen (right).](stern-gerlach.png){width=50% fig-alt=\"Stern–Gerlach experiment: an atomic beam is split into two distinct components by the inhomogeneous magnetic field, showing discrete orientations of angular momentum.\"}\n\n---\n\n## 1.2 The Einstein–de Haas Experiment\n\nSeveral years earlier, in 1915, Albert Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas performed an elegant experiment demonstrating the intimate relation between magnetism and angular momentum ([Einstein & de Haas, 1915](https://dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00012546.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}).\n\n- **Setup**: A **ferromagnetic cylinder** (often iron) is suspended by a thin fiber, allowing it to rotate freely about its vertical axis.  \n- Around the cylinder is a **coil of wire** wound on a ferromagnetic core.  \n- When a current is switched on in the coil, it changes the **magnetization** of the cylinder.  \n- A **small mirror** is attached to the suspension, so that the mechanical rotation of the cylinder can be detected optically using a reflected probe light beam.\n\n**What happens physically?**  \nWhen the magnetization of the cylinder is reversed, its internal electron magnetic moments flip orientation. Because each magnetic moment is associated with angular momentum, conservation of angular momentum requires the cylinder itself to rotate in the opposite direction. The effect is small but measurable, and the mirror–light setup amplifies the detection. The experiment showed that **magnetization arises from angular momentum**. However, the ratio of magnetic moment to angular momentum was found to differ by a factor of two from classical expectations — a puzzle later resolved by the discovery of electron spin.\n\n![Einstein–de Haas experiment: reversing the magnetization of a suspended ferromagnetic cylinder induces mechanical rotation, detected via a mirror and probe light. Important components: suspended cylinder, surrounding coil, ferromagnetic core, and optical detection system.](edehaas.png){width=50% fig-alt=\"Einstein–de Haas experiment: reversing the magnetization of a suspended ferromagnetic cylinder induces mechanical rotation, detected via a mirror and probe light.\"}\n\n---\n\n## 1.3 Historical Perspective\n\nAt the time of their original publication, neither the Stern–Gerlach nor the Einstein–de Haas experiment was interpreted in terms of an intrinsic electron spin — the very concept did not yet exist. Instead, both were framed within the language of **orbital angular momentum** and the then-prevailing Bohr–Sommerfeld model of the atom.\n\n### The Stern–Gerlach experiment\n\nStern and Gerlach themselves interpreted their observation of beam splitting as evidence for the **quantization of orbital angular momentum** along the field axis (“Richtungsquantelung”). Within the Bohr–Sommerfeld picture, an electron orbiting in a quantized elliptical trajectory would carry an orbital magnetic moment. Measuring its projection along the $z$-axis should then yield discrete values, consistent with their result.  \n\nWhat is striking in hindsight is that the silver atom has only a single valence electron in an $s$-orbital ($\\ell = 0$). The Schrödinger wave mechanics (formulated a few years later, in 1926) would predict **no orbital magnetic moment at all** in this case, and thus no splitting. Yet Stern and Gerlach observed **two distinct components**, not more and not less.  \n\nThis outcome was “accidentally” consistent with the Bohr–Sommerfeld model, which predicted two possible orientations for the angular momentum in this situation, but it could not be reconciled with a purely orbital picture once quantum mechanics matured. Only the later concept of an intrinsic two-valuedness of the electron (Pauli, 1925) and the introduction of spin provided the correct interpretation: the silver beam splits into two components because the unpaired electron has spin $s = \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\n### The Einstein–de Haas experiment\n\nEinstein and de Haas (1915) were motivated by the idea of **ring currents** — circulating electrons in atomic orbits — as the microscopic origin of magnetization. Their experiment showed directly that reversing the magnetization of a ferromagnetic sample induces mechanical rotation of the whole body, thus establishing the deep connection between **magnetic moments and angular momentum**.  \n\nHowever, when they compared the proportionality, they encountered a puzzle: the magnetic moment per unit angular momentum came out to be about **twice** the classical value expected from orbital currents. This discrepancy was a mystery at the time. In their language, it was often expressed as a “gyromagnetic ratio” differing by a factor of two from theoretical expectations.  \n\nIt was only later, with the recognition that the electron carries an intrinsic spin with $g \\approx 2$, that this factor found its natural explanation. In other words, the Einstein–de Haas effect had already measured the electron’s $g$-factor without knowing that spin existed.\n\n### Synthesis\n\nFrom today’s perspective, both experiments provided indirect evidence for electron spin long before the concept was articulated. But historically, they were interpreted through the lens of orbital angular momentum:  \n\n- **Stern–Gerlach**: seen as proof of spatial quantization of orbital angular momentum projections, though the peculiar “two-spot” pattern foreshadowed something deeper.  \n- **Einstein–de Haas**: seen as proof that magnetism stems from angular momentum, though the anomalous factor of two hinted at a hidden degree of freedom.  \n\nOnly with Pauli’s exclusion principle (1925) and the proposal of electron spin by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit (1925) were these puzzles fully understood. The reinterpretation of these classic experiments thus marks a turning point in atomic physics — from the orbital models of Bohr–Sommerfeld to the modern framework of quantum mechanics with spin.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# 2. The Electron Spin\n\nElectrons possess an **intrinsic angular momentum** called **spin** ($\\hat{\\vec{S}}$). Unlike orbital angular momentum, spin has **no classical analog**: it is a purely quantum property that must be described algebraically.  \n\nThe spin operator satisfies the **same eigenvalue equations** as orbital angular momentum:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{S}}^2 |s,m_s\\rangle = \\hbar^2 s(s+1)\\,|s,m_s\\rangle, \n\\qquad\n\\hat{S}_z |s,m_s\\rangle = \\hbar m_s\\,|s,m_s\\rangle.\n$$\n\nIn addition, the spin components obey the **same commutation relations** as the orbital angular momentum operators:\n\n$$\n[\\hat{S}_i, \\hat{S}_j] = i\\hbar\\,\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\,\\hat{S}_k,\n$$\n\nwith $\\varepsilon_{ijk}$ the Levi-Civita symbol.  \n\nFor a single electron, the spin quantum number $s$ and the magnetic spin quantum number $m_s$ take the values:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\ns &= \\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\\nm_s &= \\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n## 2.1 Notation\n\nIt is conventional to introduce the shorthand:\n\n* **Spin-up**: $|\\tfrac{1}{2}, +\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle \\equiv |\\uparrow\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$\n* **Spin-down**: $|\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle \\equiv |\\downarrow\\rangle \\equiv \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nUnlike orbital states, there is **no spatial wavefunction representation** for spin alone. Electron spin is a purely quantum property and does not correspond, as orbital angular momentum does, to the rotation of an object in space. Therefore, there is no coordinate-space representation of the spin operator (such as a differential operator) and no spatial wavefunction for spin. Instead, spin states are always described algebraically by two-component spinors.  \n\n## 2.2 Spin Operators\n\nTo satisfy the eigenvalue and commutation relations, the spin operators are represented using the **Pauli matrices**, which provide a concrete $2\\times 2$ matrix representation of spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ systems. Unlike orbital angular momentum, which is represented by differential operators acting on spatial wavefunctions, spin has no spatial representation and is instead described purely through this matrix formalism.\n\n$$\n\\hat{S}_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,\\sigma_x, \n\\qquad\n\\hat{S}_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,\\sigma_y, \n\\qquad\n\\hat{S}_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,\\sigma_z,\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\\\ i & 0\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Proof\n\n#### 1.

Magnetic Moments\n\nThe angular momentum of an electron is associated with a magnetic moment $\\vec \\mu$. There are two contributions:\n\n- **Orbital magnetic moment**: \n  $$\n  \\vec{\\mu}_\\ell = g_\\ell \\, \\mu_B \\, \\vec{L}, \\quad \\text{with } g_\\ell = 1\n  $$\n- **Spin magnetic moment**: \n  $$\n  \\vec{\\mu}_s = g_s \\, \\mu_B \\, \\vec{S}, \\quad \\text{with } g_s \\approx 2\n  $$\n\nHere, $g$ is the **g-factor**, and $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the **Bohr magneton**.  \n\nFor orbital angular momentum, $g_\\ell = 1$, which reproduces the classical relation between angular momentum and magnetic moment derived from **Larmor theory**. That is, a circulating charge creates a magnetic dipole proportional to its angular momentum, in full agreement with classical electrodynamics.  \n\nFor the electron spin, $g_s \\approx 2$, which **cannot be explained classically**. This value emerges rigorously from **relativistic quantum mechanics** via the Dirac equation (not derived here), and it is confirmed experimentally, for example in the **Einstein–de Haas experiment** (1915). The factor $g_s \\neq 1$ is therefore a pure quantum-relativistic effect, reflecting the intrinsic nature of spin.  \n\n\n---\n\n# 4. The Fine Structure Interaction\n\n## 4.1 Spin–Orbit Interaction and the Hamiltonian\n\nBecause both orbital and spin angular momenta give rise to magnetic moments, they interact with each other. This interaction contributes an additional **spin–orbit term**, $\\hat{H}_{\\rm SO}$, to the Hamiltonian.

We can express the interaction term using the total angular momentum:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{J}}^2 = \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2 + \\hat{\\vec{S}}^2 + 2\\,\\hat{\\vec{L}}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{S}}\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\hat{\\vec{L}}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{S}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\big(\\hat{\\vec{J}}^2 - \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2 - \\hat{\\vec{S}}^2\\big).\n$$\n\n\nThe operators $\\hat{J}^2$ and $\\hat{J}_z$ commute with the Hamiltonian, so the quantum numbers $j$ and $m_j$ are now conserved. Their eigenvalues follow the standard angular momentum relations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\vec{J}}^2|j,m_j\\rangle &= \\hbar^2 j(j+1)|j,m_j\\rangle\\\\\n\\hat{J}_z|j,m_j\\rangle &= \\hbar m_j|j,m_j\\rangle\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe possible values for $j$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series: \n\n$$|\\ell-s| \\le j \\le \\ell+s.$$ \n\n\nThe new **complete set of quantum numbers** for the hydrogen atom, when spin is included, is\n\n$$\n|n,\\ell,s,j,m_j\\rangle.\n$$\n\nThese states are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, and therefore provide the most convenient description of the system. The eigenvalue relation of the spin-orbit operator follows \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\vec{L}}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{S}} |n,\\ell,s,j,m_j\\rangle = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\big(\\hat{\\vec{J}}^2 - \\hat{\\vec{L}}^2 - \\hat{\\vec{S}}^2\\big) |n,\\ell,s,j,m_j\\rangle\\\\\n= \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}(j(j+1)-\\ell(\\ell+1)-s(s+1))|n,\\ell,s,j,m_j\\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n![Illustration of L–S coupling.

The set spans the whole Hilbert space (completeness).\n\nFor such a basis, the **identity operator** can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{I} = \\sum_i |a_i\\rangle \\langle a_i|.\n$$\n\nThis operator acts like the \"do nothing\" operator, since for any state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n\n$$\n\\hat{I}|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i |a_i\\rangle \\langle a_i|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle.\n$$\n\nIn our case, the \"old\" states $\\{|n,\\ell,m_\\ell,s,m_s\\rangle\\}$ form a complete basis, so we may freely insert\n\n$$\n\\hat{I} = \\sum_{m_\\ell,m_s} |n,\\ell,m_\\ell,s,m_s\\rangle \\langle n,\\ell,m_\\ell,s,m_s|.\n$$\n\nThis is how the new coupled states $|n,\\ell,s,j,m_j\\rangle$ can be expressed as superpositions of the old ones.\n:::\n\n## 4.3 Eigenenergies\n\nIf we include the spin–orbit interaction in the Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\hat{\\vec p}^{\\,2}}{2\\mu} \\;+\\; V(\\hat{\\vec r})\n\\;+\\; \\hat{H}_{\\rm SO},\n$$\n\nthen the energy levels can no longer be labeled only by $n$.  \nInstead, they split according to the **total angular momentum** quantum number $j$ and the orbital angular momentum quantum number $\\ell$, so the eigenenergies depend on the set $(n, \\ell, j)$.\n\nHowever, this approach is incomplete. A fully consistent calculation of the fine structure requires additional relativistic corrections, which we do not discuss here in detail:\n\n- the **Darwin term**, arising from the \"zitterbewegung\" of the electron,  \n- and the **Thomas precession correction**, which modifies the effective strength of the spin–orbit interaction.\n\nWhen these effects are combined with the spin–orbit coupling, the result is the same fine structure spectrum that is obtained directly from the **Dirac equation**. \n\nIn the Dirac theory, the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (including the rest energy of the electron) are given by\n\n$$\nE_{n,j} \\;=\\; m c^2 \\left[ 1 + \n\\left( \\frac{Z \\alpha}{n - (j + \\tfrac{1}{2}) + \\sqrt{(j+\\tfrac{1}{2})^2 - (Z\\alpha)^2}} \\right)^2\n\\right]^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}} ,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ ($\\alpha=\\tfrac{1}{137}$) is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the nuclear charge.  \n\nThe above energies depend only on $n$ and $j$. Thus, while the Schrödinger equation with spin–orbit interaction suggests a dependence on $\\ell$, the **full relativistic treatment (or including the missing correction terms) removes this $\\ell$-dependence**.\n\n---\n\n## 4.4 Fine-Structure Energy Shift\n\nIt is often more useful to consider the **fine-structure shift** rather than the full electron energy given above. This shift can be viewed as a small correction to the non-relativistic Bohr energies, which are expressed as:\n\n$$\nE_n^{(0)} = - \\frac{\\mu c^2 (Z\\alpha)^2}{2 n^2},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the electron. To leading order in $(Z\\alpha)^2$, the shift due to relativistic effects and spin–orbit interaction becomes\n\n$$\n\\Delta E_{n,j}^{\\rm FS} = E_n^{(0)} \\, (Z\\alpha)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{1}{j + 1/2} - \\frac{3}{4 n^2} \\right).\n$$\n\nThus, the total energy including fine structure is\n\n$$\nE_{n,j} \\approx E_n^{(0)} + \\Delta E_{n,j}^{\\rm FS}.\n$$\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The first term in parentheses arises from the **spin–orbit interaction**.  \n- The second term arises from the **relativistic correction to the kinetic energy**.  \n- As in the full Dirac theory, the energy now depends on $n$ and $j$, but **not on $\\ell$** individually, consistent with experiment.\n\n\n---\n\n# 5. Term Symbols and Naming Conventions\n\nIn atomic and molecular physics (AMO), **term symbols** are used to describe the electronic states, including the splitting due to the fine structure. The general notation is:\n\n$${}^{2S+1}L_J$$\n\n* **n**: The principal quantum number (sometimes included).\n* **$2S+1$**: The **multiplicity**.\n* **L**: A letter representing the orbital angular
