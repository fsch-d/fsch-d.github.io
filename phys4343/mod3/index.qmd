## Why Hydrogen?

Hydrogen is the simplest atom, consisting of just one electron bound to one proton. Despite its simplicity, it provides the **paradigm** for quantum mechanics in atoms:  
  
- It is one of the very few systems where the Schrödinger equation can be solved *exactly*.  
- Its spectrum was central to the historical development of quantum theory.  
- Many techniques used for hydrogen generalize to more complex atoms and molecules.

## Scope of this Section

In this chapter, we study hydrogen in the **nonrelativistic Schrödinger picture**.  
Our goals are:

- Solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the Coulomb potential.  
- Separate variables in spherical coordinates and identify **radial and angular parts**.  
  See [Orbital Angular Momentum](angmom.qmd) for the derivation of the spherical harmonics and the angular eigenproblem.  
- Derive the **hydrogenic eigenenergies** and their degeneracies.  
  See [The Hydrogen Atom](hydrogen.qmd) for the radial equation and energy quantization.  
- Explore the structure of the **spatial wavefunctions** (orbitals) through graphical representations.  
  See [Visualizing Hydrogen Orbitals](orbitals.qmd) — *placeholder / forthcoming*.  
- Connect angular momentum quantum numbers $(\ell,m)$ with the orbital shapes and nodal structure.  

This material provides the **foundation** for later refinements (spin, relativistic corrections, Lamb shift, hyperfine structure) treated in the [Hydrogen (Details)](../mod4/spin.qmd) chapter.

## A Final Remark

Hydrogen is not just a “toy problem.” It remains a **testing ground for quantum mechanics** and a reference point for experiments across physics, from spectroscopy to astrophysics. By mastering the hydrogen atom at this basic level, we gain insight into both the methods of quantum mechanics and the rich structure of atomic physics.
