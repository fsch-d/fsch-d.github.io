## Ket-vectors
A **ket vector** $\ket{\alpha}$ denotes an element of a vector space, more specifically a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$.  
It represents a **quantum state**, for example a wave function or a spin state.

## Bra-vectors
A **bra vector** $\bra{\beta}$ denotes an element of the dual space of $\mathscr{H}$.  
It is a linear form that maps each vector in $\mathscr{H}$ into the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ by means of the **inner product**:

$$
\braket{\beta}{\alpha} \in \mathbb{C}.
$$

For example, a wave function $\psi(\vec{r})$ corresponding to a state $\ket{\psi}$ is obtained by mapping it into coordinate space using the inner product:

$$
\braket{\vec{r}}{\psi} = \psi(\vec{r}).
$$

### Inner product for wave functions
For two wave functions $\psi(x)$ and $\phi(x)$, the inner product is defined as

$$
\braket{\phi}{\psi} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi^\ast(x)\,\psi(x)\,dx,
$$

where $\phi^\ast(x)$ is the complex conjugate of $\phi(x)$.  
This definition guarantees that inner products are complex numbers, and it provides the mathematical foundation for probability amplitudes in quantum mechanics.

## Linear operators
An **operator** $\hat{O}$ acting on a ket creates another ket:

$$
\hat{O}\ket{\psi} = \ket{\phi}.
$$

A **linear operator** satisfies the two additional conditions:

1. $\hat{O}(\ket{\psi}+\ket{\phi}) = \hat{O}\ket{\psi} + \hat{O}\ket{\phi}$  
2. $\hat{O}c\ket{\psi} = c\hat{O}\ket{\psi}$

**Additional notes:**

- The operator can also be written as an outer product:  
  $$
  \hat{O} = \frac{1}{\braket{\psi}{\psi}} \ketbra{\phi}{\psi}.
  $$
- If $\{\ket{\phi_i}\}$ is a complete basis of $\mathscr{H}$, a linear operator $\hat{O}$ can be written as a matrix with entries  
  $$
  O_{ij} = \mel{\phi_j}{\hat{O}}{\phi_i}.
  $$

## Hermitian conjugates
The **Hermitian conjugate** of a vector or operator is denoted by a $\dagger$ (called *dagger*).  
The rules are:

- The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.  
- The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate (denoted with a superscript $^\ast$).  
- The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself.  
- For any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators in bra–ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate is computed by reversing the order and taking the conjugate of each component.

**Examples:**

- $\ket{\psi}^\dagger = \bra{\psi}$ and $\bra{\psi}^\dagger = \ket{\psi}$  
- $\big(c_1\ket{\psi_1} + c_2\ket{\psi_2}\big)^\dagger = c_1^\ast \bra{\psi_1} + c_2^\ast \bra{\psi_2}$  
- $\big(\braket{\psi}{\phi}\big)^\dagger = \braket{\psi}{\phi}^\ast = \braket{\phi}{\psi}$  
- $\big(\mel{\phi}{\hat{A}^\dagger}{\psi}\big)^\ast = \mel{\psi}{\hat{A}}{\phi}$  
  and  
  $\big(\mel{\phi}{\hat{A}^\dagger \hat{B}^\dagger}{\psi}\big)^\ast = \mel{\psi}{\hat{B}\hat{A}}{\phi}$  

## Observables
**Observables** are represented by Hermitian operators. “Hermitian” means $\hat{A} = \hat{A}^\dagger$.  
They are associated with measurable physical quantities (e.g., energy, momentum, angular momentum, spin).

### Properties
- The eigenvalues $a$ of a Hermitian operator $\hat{A}$, satisfying $\hat{A}\ket{\alpha} = a\ket{\alpha}$, are **real numbers**.  
- For every observable, a **complete and orthonormal basis** can be found:  
  - The basis is given by eigenvectors solving  
    $\hat{A}\ket{n} = a_n\ket{n}$ (discrete spectrum) or $\hat{A}\ket{k} = k\ket{k}$ (continuous spectrum).  
  - Orthonormality: $\braket{n'}{n} = \delta_{n'n}$ or $\braket{k_i}{k_j} = \delta(k_i-k_j)$.  
  - Completeness: every state $\ket{\psi}$ in $\mathscr{H}$ can be expressed as  
    $\ket{\psi} = \sum_n c_n\ket{n}$ or $\ket{\psi} = \int c(k)\ket{k}\,dk$.  
  - The identity operator can be written as $\mathbb{1} = \sum_n \ketbra{n}{n}$ or $\mathbb{1} = \int \ketbra{k}{k}\,dk$.

### Additional notes
If $\ket{\alpha}$ is a normalized eigenvector of $\hat{A}$ and the system is in the normalized state $\ket{\psi}$, then:

- The probability of finding the system in state $\ket{\alpha}$ is  
  $$
  P = \left|\braket{\alpha}{\psi}\right|^2.
  $$
- The expectation value of $\hat{A}$ is  
  $$
  \langle \hat{A} \rangle = \mel{\psi}{\hat{A}}{\psi}.
  $$
- The variance of $\hat{A}$ is  
  $$
  \sigma_A = \langle \hat{A}^2 \rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle^2.
  $$
