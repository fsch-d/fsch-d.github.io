# Prerequisites

To benefit most from this course, students are expected to have completed:

- **Mathematics**
  - Linear Algebra  
  - Calculus (single- and multivariable)  
  - Differential Equations  

- **Physics**
  - Introduction to Classical Mechanics  
  - Introduction to Electromagnetism  
  - Introduction to Modern Physics  

---

# Disclaimer

This lecture is intended as an **introductory-level course** in AMO physics.  
Quantum mechanics is used throughout.  

- A **formal course in quantum mechanics is *not* required**, but many ideas and techniques of QM will appear repeatedly.  
- For this reason, a **very brief introduction** to some quantum mechanical concepts is included.  
- These remarks are **not comprehensive** and are meant only to provide enough background to follow the AMO applications.

# A Few Words about AMO Physics

**Atomic, Molecular, and Optical physics** is one of the most dynamic areas of modern physics.  

- It connects fundamental quantum concepts with cutting-edge experiments.  
- It has direct applications in **laser physics, precision spectroscopy, quantum optics, quantum information, and ultracold matter**.  
- AMO physics combines the clarity of well-understood model systems (like the hydrogen atom) with the excitement of current research that pushes the boundaries of technology and fundamental science.  

Whether your interest lies in the **foundations of quantum theory**, the **applications in modern technology**, or simply the **beauty of light–matter interaction**, AMO physics offers a rich and fascinating journey.
