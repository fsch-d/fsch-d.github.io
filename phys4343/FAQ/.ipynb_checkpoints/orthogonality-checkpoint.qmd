# Why are eigenvectors orthogonal in Quantum Mechanics?

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors (or eigenstates) corresponding to different eigenvalues of an observable are orthogonal. This is a fundamental property that arises directly from the mathematical nature of the operators representing physical observables. These operators are **Hermitian**.

## The Hermitian operator

A linear operator $\hat{A}$ is defined as Hermitian if it is equal to its Hermitian conjugate (or adjoint) $\hat{A}^\dagger$. The defining property of a Hermitian operator in bra-ket notation is:

$$ \langle\phi|\hat{A}\psi\rangle = \langle\hat{A}\phi|\psi\rangle $$

for any two state vectors $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$ in the Hilbert space.

## Proof of orthogonality for distinct eigenvalues

Let's consider a Hermitian operator $\hat{A}$ and two of its eigenstates, $|\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$, with corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$.

$$ \hat{A}|\psi_1\rangle = \lambda_1|\psi_1\rangle $$
$$ \hat{A}|\psi_2\rangle = \lambda_2|\psi_2\rangle $$

We can use these relations to prove the orthogonality.

1.  **Start with the inner product involving the operator and the first eigenstate.**
    
    $$ \langle\psi_2|\hat{A}|\psi_1\rangle = \langle\psi_2|\lambda_1\psi_1\rangle = \lambda_1\langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle $$

2.  **Use the Hermitian property to rewrite the same inner product.**
    
    $$ \langle\psi_2|\hat{A}|\psi_1\rangle = \langle\hat{A}\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle $$

3.  **Substitute the second eigenstate equation into the rewritten inner product.** Since eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real ($\lambda_2^* = \lambda_2$), we have:
    
    $$ \langle\hat{A}\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle = \langle\lambda_2\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle = \lambda_2^*\langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle = \lambda_2\langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle $$

4.  **Equate the results from steps 1 and 3.**
    
    $$ \lambda_1\langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle = \lambda_2\langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle $$

5.  **Rearrange the equation.**
    
    $$ (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)\langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle = 0 $$

6.  **Conclude the orthogonality.** If the eigenvalues are distinct, meaning $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$, then $(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)$ is a non-zero number. For the equation to hold, the inner product must be zero.
    
    $$ \langle\psi_2|\psi_1\rangle = 0 $$
    
    This is the definition of orthogonality.

## The physical implication

The orthogonality of eigenstates means that if a quantum system is prepared in a state corresponding to a definite value of an observable (an eigenstate), then a measurement of that observable will always yield that value. The probability of measuring any other value (corresponding to a different eigenstate) is zero. This guarantees that measurement outcomes for distinct eigenvalues are mutually exclusive.
