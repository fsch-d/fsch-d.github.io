## Atomic Transitions and Radiation

### What processes result in transitions? How are they related to one another? What are transition rate/probabilities?

When an atom interacts with radiation, there are only three basic processes that can connect two levels $|k\rangle$ (lower) and $|i\rangle$ (upper): **absorption**, **stimulated (induced) emission**, and **spontaneous emission**. These processes are quantified by the *Einstein coefficients*.  

Let us introduce the spectral energy density of the radiation field,
$$
\mathcal{w}(\nu) = n(\nu) h\nu,
$$
where  
* $n(\nu)$ is the number of photons per unit volume in the frequency interval $\Delta\nu=1\ \text{s}^{-1}$,  
* $h\nu$ is the photon energy.  

---

#### 1. Absorption
When an atom in the lower state $|k\rangle$ absorbs a photon of the right frequency $\nu$, it is promoted to the upper state $|i\rangle$. The transition probability per unit time is
$$
\frac{dP_{k\to i}^{\text{abs}}}{dt} = B_{ki}\, \mathcal{W}(\nu),
$$
where $B_{ki}$ is the Einstein coefficient for absorption.

---

#### 2. Stimulated (induced) emission
If an atom is already in the excited state $|i\rangle$, the presence of photons with frequency $\nu$ can stimulate it to decay back to $|k\rangle$, emitting an additional photon *coherent* with the incoming field:
$$
\frac{dP_{i\to k}^{\text{ind}}}{dt} = B_{ik}\, \mathcal{W}(\nu),
$$
with $B_{ik}$ the Einstein coefficient for induced emission.

---

#### 3. Spontaneous emission
Even in the absence of radiation, an excited atom will eventually decay. The probability per unit time for this is
$$
\frac{dP_{i\to k}^{\text{spont}}}{dt} = A_{ik},
$$
where $A_{ik}$ is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. The emitted photons are isotropic and random in phase and direction.

### Connection through thermal equilibrium

Suppose $N_i$ atoms are in the excited state and $N_k$ in the lower state. In the presence of radiation, transitions occur in both directions. At **steady state**, detailed balance requires:
$$
B_{ki}\,\mathcal{W}(\nu)\,N_k = \big(B_{ik}\,\mathcal{W}(\nu) + A_{ik}\big)\,N_i. \quad (1)
$$

On the other hand, in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, populations follow the Boltzmann distribution:
$$
\frac{N_i}{N_k} = \frac{g_i}{g_k}\, e^{-h\nu/k_B T}, \quad (2)
$$
with $g = 2J+1$ the degeneracy factor (statistical weight).

Substituting (2) into (1) and solving for $\mathcal{W}(\nu)$ gives
$$
\mathcal{W}(\nu) = \frac{A_{ik}/B_{ik}}{(g_k/g_i)(B_{ki}/B_{ik})\, e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1}. \quad (3)
$$

### Comparison with Planck’s law

The spectral energy density of thermal radiation is given by Planck’s law:
$$
\mathcal{W}(\nu) = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3}\,\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1}. \quad (4)
$$

Comparing (3) and (4) yields the fundamental relations between Einstein coefficients:

- **Symmetry relation**  
$$
B_{ik} = \frac{g_k}{g_i}\,B_{ki}.
$$

- **Link between spontaneous and stimulated emission**  
$$
A_{ik} = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3}\,B_{ik}.
$$

### Physical interpretation

- The factor $\tfrac{8\pi\nu^2}{c^3}$ is the density of electromagnetic modes in the frequency interval $\Delta\nu=1\ \text{s}^{-1}$.  
- The ratio of induced to spontaneous emission rates into a single mode equals the average photon number in that mode:
$$
\frac{P_{i\to k}^{\text{ind}}}{P_{i\to k}^{\text{spont}}} = n(\nu).
$$

This result has a deep physical meaning:  
- **Spontaneous emission** can be thought of as emission into the *vacuum fluctuations* of the field (corresponding to $n(\nu)=0$).  
- **Stimulated emission** becomes dominant once many photons are already present — this is the amplification principle underlying lasers.

### What processes result in transitions? How are they related to one another? What are transition rate/probabilities?

Suppose there is a radiation field with spectral energy density $\omega(\nu) = n(\nu)h\nu$.  
* $n(\nu)$ is the number of photons in a unit volume in the frequency interval $\Delta\nu=1\text{s}^{-1}$.  
* $h\nu$ is the photon energy.

#### 1. Probability per time for an absorption:
$$
\frac{dP_{\text{ki}}^{\text{abs}}}{dt} = B_{\text{ki}} \omega(\nu)
$$
$B_{\text{ki}}$: Einstein Coefficient of induced absorption.

#### 2. Probability per time for an induced emission:
$$
\frac{dP_{\text{ik}}^{\text{ind}}}{dt} = B_{\text{ik}} \omega(\nu)
$$
$B_{\text{ik}}$: Einstein coefficient of induced emission.

#### 3. Probability per time for a spontaneous emission:
$$
\frac{dP_{\text{ik}}^{\text{spont}}}{dt} = A_{\text{ik}}
$$
$A_{\text{ik}}$: Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. These photons are emitted in all directions.

Consider $N_{\text{i}}$ atoms in excited state, $N_{\text{k}}$ atoms in ground state, in a radiation field. In steady state emission and absorption rates are identical:
$$
B_{\text{ki}} \omega(\nu) N_{\text{k}} = (B_{\text{ik}} \omega(\nu) + A_{\text{ik}}) N_{\text{i}} \quad (1)
$$
At thermal equilibrium, populations follow Boltzmann distribution (no proof here, cf. stat. mech.).
$$
\frac{N_{\text{i}}}{N_{\text{k}}} = \frac{g_{\text{i}}}{g_{\text{k}}} e^{-(E_{\text{i}}-E_{\text{k}})/k_{\text{B}}T} = \frac{g_{\text{i}}}{g_{\text{k}}} e^{-h\nu/k_{\text{B}}T} \quad (2)
$$
$g = 2J+1$ statistical weight (number of states).

From (2) in (1) and solving for $\omega(\nu)$ yields:
$$
\omega_{\nu}(\nu) = \frac{A_{\text{ik}}/B_{\text{ik}}}{(g_{\text{k}}/g_{\text{i}})(B_{\text{ki}}/B_{\text{ik}})e^{h\nu/k_{\text{B}}T} - 1} \quad (3)
$$

On the other hand, the spectral energy density follows the Planck radiation law:
$$
\omega_{\nu}(\nu) = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_{\text{B}}T} - 1} \quad (4)
$$

Comparing (3) and (4) yields the relations:
$$
\frac{g_{\text{k}}}{g_{\text{i}}} \cdot B_{\text{ki}} = B_{\text{ik}} \quad \text{and} \quad A_{\text{ik}}/B_{\text{ik}} = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3}
$$
Or
$$
B_{\text{ik}} = \frac{g_{\text{k}}}{g_{\text{i}}} B_{\text{ki}}
$$
$$
A_{\text{ik}} = \frac{8\pi h \nu^3}{c^3} B_{\text{ik}}
$$

**Note:** $\frac{8\pi \nu^2}{c^3}$ gives the number of modes within the frequency interval $\Delta\nu=1\text{s}^{-1}$.

The ratio of induced to spontaneous emission rates into one mode of the radiation field equals the number of photons in this mode.
$$
\frac{P_{\text{ik}}^{\text{ind}}}{P_{\text{ik}}^{\text{spont}}} = \frac{B_{\text{ik}}h\nu}{A_{\text{ik}}(c^3/8\pi h\nu^3)} = n(\nu)
$$
