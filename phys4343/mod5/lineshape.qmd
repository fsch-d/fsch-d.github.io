### Summary: The Lorentzian Natural Lineshape

#### The Phenomenon

The natural lineshape of an atomic transition is Lorentzian. This arises from the finite lifetime of an atom's excited state. As an atom in an excited state decays, it spontaneously emits a photon, a process governed by quantum mechanics. This exponential decay in the time domain, a consequence of the Weisskopf-Wigner theory, corresponds to a Lorentzian function in the frequency domain due to the time-energy form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

#### Foundational Principles

*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The finite lifetime ($\Delta t$) of an excited state results in an intrinsic uncertainty in its energy ($\Delta E$), which manifests as a broadening of the emitted photon's frequency.
    $$ \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} $$
*   **Fourier Transform:** Mathematically, the lineshape is derived by performing a Fourier transform on the time-dependent amplitude of the emitted electromagnetic wave. The Fourier transform of an exponential decay is a Lorentzian function.
*   **Spontaneous Emission:** This phenomenon is not predicted by classical electrodynamics but is explained by the interaction of a quantum system with the electromagnetic vacuum field, described by quantum electrodynamics (QED).

#### Derivation of Exponential Decay

The exponential decay of the atomic dipole moment is not a postulate but is derived from first principles using two key theoretical frameworks:

1.  **Weisskopf-Wigner Theory:** By solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation for an atom interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field, the amplitude of the initial excited state is found to decay exponentially over time. This, in turn, causes the expectation value of the dipole moment to decay exponentially.
2.  **Fermi's Golden Rule:** This approach calculates the transition rate between quantum states using time-dependent perturbation theory. For a weak perturbation and a continuous density of final states (the vacuum), the decay rate is constant, leading to an exponential decay of the excited state population and, consequently, the dipole moment.

#### The Role of Coherence

*   **Amplitude Product:** The time-dependent expectation value of the dipole moment, $\langle\hat{\mathbf{\mu}}(t)\rangle$, is proportional to the product of the complex excited-state and ground-state amplitudes, $c_e^*(t)c_g(t)$.
*   **Time Evolution:** At $t=0$, the atom is fully in the excited state ($c_e=1, c_g=0$), so the coherence term $c_e^*c_g$ is zero. It initially increases as the atom decays and the ground state becomes populated, before eventually decaying exponentially along with the overall population difference.
*   **Decay of Coherence:** The exponential decay associated with the Lorentzian lineshape is a result of the decay of the quantum coherence between the excited and ground states, not a simple decay from the very start. The initial non-exponential rise of the coherence is a subtle detail that causes minor deviations from the ideal Lorentzian lineshape.

#### Summary of the Product $c_e^* c_g$

*   **Definition:** The product $c_e^*(t)c_g(t)$ is a time-dependent complex number representing the coherence between the two states.
*   **Phase:** Its phase is not a simple value but is determined by the complex interplay of the atomic states and the vacuum field. It oscillates at the transition frequency of the atom.
*   **Amplitude:** Its amplitude grows from zero and then decays, with the exponential decay rate being the dominant feature for most of the emission process.

#### Conclusion

The Lorentzian natural lineshape is a robust consequence of the fundamental quantum mechanical interaction between an atom and the electromagnetic vacuum. While the underlying coherence term exhibits a more complex time evolution (initial growth before exponential decay), the dominant and defining characteristic for practical purposes is the exponential damping of the atomic dipole moment, which dictates the observed Lorentzian spectrum.
